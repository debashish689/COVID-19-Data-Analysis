COVID-19 Data Analysis:

This program presents a comparative visual analysis of COVID-19 cases in several countries around the world in the
timespan, starting on January 22. 2020 and going up until May 12. 2021.

1. At first the program reads the filenames in the 'COUNTRY_DIRECTORY' and makes a list-type variable, 'countries',
  containing all the filenames(.txt). and another list-type variable, 'normalized_countries' is created containing
  uppercase version of the above filenames.
  
2. Now for each filename in 'countries', the original file in the 'COUNTRY_DIRECTORY' is read and for each file a
  list-type variable, 'list_of_cumulative_cases' containing number of cumulative cases for each day is created. And from
  'list_of_cumulative_cases', another list, 'list_of_daily_cases' containing number of individual daily cases for each
  day is created.
  
  And each 'list_of_daily_cases' is stored against corresponding country_name (obtained by omitting '.TXT' from each filename)
  in the dictionary-type variable, 'countries_daily_data_dict' defined by 'country_name -> list_of_daily_cases' pair.
  
3. Now the user is instructed to enter country_names of his/her choice from the list of keys in the
  'countries_daily_data_dict'. the user can enter the country_name in both upper and lower case. The entered valid
  country_names (i.e. country_names for which data are available) are stored in a list, 'countries_to_compare'.

  The analysis can be performed in two ways: 
  mode 1: For doing analysis for last few days from the 'data ending date'.
  mode 2: For doing analysis between any two dates within the range from 'data starting date' upto 'data ending date'.
          The mode of analysis is determined by the user.
          
4. Now for each country in 'countries_to_compare', the corresponding section (in the range specified by the user)
  of list of values from the 'countries_daily_data_dict' is obtained and stored in  corresponding list,
  'list_of_data_to_compare' for that country.
  
5. The values in each 'list_of_data_to_compare' for each country in 'countries_to_compare' are converted to fractions of
  the largest value and each set of fractions for each country is stored in corresponding list, 'daily_fractions' and
  each 'daily_fractions' is stored under corresponding country_name in dictionary, 'countries_data_fractions', defined by
  country_name -> 'daily_fractions'.
  
6. Now for each country / 'daily_fractions' pair in the 'countries_data_fractions', an image containing a series of
  coloured data stripes (representing number of daily cases on each day relative to the highest daily cases for that
  country) is created using 'daily_fractions' and for each country, its image is stored in the 'visualizations_dict'
  dictionary.
  
7. At last all the images stored in 'visualizations_dict' are accessed one by one by each country_name and image for
  each country is shown on screen and saved in the home_directory one after another.
